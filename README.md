# MachineLearningPractices
Practices of NTUST Machine Learning classes. Tackle UCI Adult Income Classification and Kaggle Spooky Author Dataset. As given by the following:
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification

Solution is done using two approach: 
- Decision Trees
- Neural Network (Including Transfer learning from transformer: BERT and DistillBERT). 

Step by step EDA, model building, dimension reduction approach are done detailed inside the .ipynb. Welcome to see each ipynb files.
